The issue you faced: I am using Visual Studio Community 2022 via Parallels on a Macbook Pro M2. There are configuration issues that I keep facing with the Visual Studio extensions and package installation. Every time some on the other issue show up either while debugging the program or while executing a command through terminal. 
The references you used: I used several references like youtube videos, chatgpt & copilot. I also reached out to Prof Nathan as this problem has been consistent since September's semester. He helped me by providing several solutions but we couldn't really get it resolved completely. There were times when the Visual Studio Community 2022 wouldn't let us commit the code on Git. As a result, we downlaoded Github Desktop in order to commit and push the changes. Sometimes it would work and sometimes it won't. 
What you tried to fix the problem: I tried uninstalling the Visual Studio 2022 and reinstalled the required libraries, frameworks and created few testing files to ensure if everything was working fine or not. To an extent, for CalculatorAPI assignment I had used my roommate's laptop to work on it. 
Whether or not the problem was fixed: Its still the same and i am unable to figure out what's wrong and where exactly things are lacking.
